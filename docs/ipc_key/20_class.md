**[^14]: The relevant meaning of uddesa here would be, cf. Cone s.v.: "that to which one refers, point**



**of authority".**



**Cf. also BHSD s.v. śramaṇoddeśa: "a subordinate of a (Buddhist) monk" and MW s.v. uddeśya: "anything to which one refers or which one has in view".**



**There are analogous formations in attuddesa "intended for oneself" (cf. Cone s.v.) and in aññasatthāruddesa "adopting another teacher".**



**Based on this, I would take the meaning of samaṇuddesa as "who refers to a samaṇa as his point of authority" and would analyze as a dutiya tappurisa. But: cum grano salis.**



**[^15]: So also Ñāṇatusita, but puna(r) is an ind.**



**I wonder if it could also be classified as avyayībhāva that retains its case ending, cf. Duroiselle: "Sometimes, however, the case-ending is retained; the cases thus retained being mostly the Ablative and the Locative."**

**this can be classified as an ablative of cause. Cf. Wijesekara, para. 122: "This use of the abl. brings it into contact with the inst. which as we have seen elsewhere (§67) is also employed to denote reason or cause. Pāṇinī has two parallel rules to that effect7 and Kaccāyana lays down the same rule in both cases, viz. 'hetvatthe' (291 & 277 hetu). [...] It may denote the cause proper, in which case it can be rendered by such expressions as "from", "through", "as a result of" or "in consequence of". e.g., āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ upasampajja A I.107; D III.102 "**
