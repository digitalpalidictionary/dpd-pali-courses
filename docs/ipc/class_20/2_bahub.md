From this we can see that any type of **compound**, kammadāraya, tappurisa etc., can be turned into an **adjective**, in which case it can become a **bahubbīhi-samāsa**.

***

***

This compound needs to be **translated with a relative clause** such as “who...”, “which…”, “that …”, “with...” etc.

Furthermore, this compound can also be **used independently** as a noun with an implied subject. “the man who….”, “the ascetic who...”, “the robe which….” etc.
