# Perfect Past Tense (*parokkhā*)
***
Kaccāyana 417. apaccakk’parokkhā’tīte.
***
“when not present to sight, perfect past”
***
This tense is very rare in Pāli. So much so, that there seems to be some contradiction between traditional grammars and modern grammars about what it actually means!
***
The name itself **parokkhā** comes from **paro + akkha**, which means “beyond the eye, unseen, unknown.” Its opposite is **sammukhā**, which means “face to face with, in the presence of”
***
The **parokkhā** is supposed to refer to a past action that was unseen by the speaker, e.g. “The ancient sages said...”
***
But, modern grammars have given it the name of - **Perfect Past Tense,** which is a tense common to Indo-European languages. It means a completed past action. “He **had cooked** the food.”
***
Whatever the exact meaning, there are so few examples of it in Pāli, that you are safe translating it as a normal past tense, something that happened a long time ago, a completed action, something the speaker personally did not witness.

Theoretically there is also a **Passive Perfect Past**, but that’s enough non-existent grammatical forms for now.
***
When the Perfect Past occurs in suttas, it is frequently from the irregular root √ah (to speak) - *different form of root √brū*. Has the following forms:

**āha** – said (he had said)

**āhaṃsu** – they said (they had said)

**āhu** – they said (they had said)
