# Aorist (*ajjatanī*)
***
Kaccāyana 419. samīpe’jjatanī.
***
“when recent, aorist.”
***
Ajja “means” today in Pāli. As the name implies, this past tense was originally only used for the recent past, things that happened earlier today.
***
Today **I went** to the village.
***
ajja gāmaṃ **agacchiṃ**
***
But in the Canon we find that, apart from a few cases in poetry, the aorist now covers all past actions.
***
Please conjugate the word **chindati** (cuts) in the aorist active voice.
***
Let’s look at the present tense **reflexive** **voice** and **passive voice**.
***
(Theory) How is the reflexive formed? How is the passive formed?

Although Passive Aorist with Attanopada endings exist in theory. If you find an example of those, please let us know :)
