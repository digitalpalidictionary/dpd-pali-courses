## Three Voices: Active, Reflexive and Passive

***

In English there are only **two voices**, active and passive.

***

***

Active voice: The man cut the tree

***

Passive: The tree is cut by the man.

***

***

In Pāli that would be rendered as

***

***

puriso rukkhaṃ chindati

***

rukkho purisena chindīyati

***

***

***

In Sanskrit, there are **three distinct voices of verbs**, active, **reflexive or middle** and passive. In Pāli (as in all the other Prakrit languages), only two voices are now primarily used, the active and the passive.

***

***

The only time you will encounter the middle or reflexive voice is in poetry, but it is important to recognise it, since these verses contain important and subtle doctrinal ideas.

***

### Active Voice

***

Almost all the verbs you have dealt with so far have been in the active **voice**.

***

***

the way the active voice is constructed is:

***

***

**root + conjugational sign \> base**

***

√dhā (to put) + a \> daha (irreg)

***

***

**prefixes + base + parassapada verbal endings**

***

saṃ + ā + daha + ti \> samādahati

***

***

Hopefully you have no problems with that.

***

### Passive Voice

***

You have also learned how to form passive verbs in this way:

***

***

**root + passive sign \> passive base**

***

√dhā + iya \> dhiya (pass)

***

***

**prefixes + passive base + parassapada verbal endings**

***

saṃ + ā + dhiya + ti \> samādhiyati

***

***

***

### Middle Voice or Reflexive Voice

***

As mentioned, this voice has virtually died out in prose, but still exists to a significant degree within verse. First let’s look at the construction, then at the meaning.

***

***

the middle voice is constructed using an **active base** with **attanopada verbal endings**.

***

***

**root + conjugational sign \> base**

***

√labh (to get) + a \> labha

***

**prefixes + base + attanopada verbal ending**

***

labha + **te** \> labha**te**

***

***

***

How to translate this?

***

***

Reflexive verbs can be translated into English with a **reflexive pronoun.**

***

***

labha**te**

***

he **himself** gets something

***

he obtains something **for himself**

***

***

The reflexive voice contains the idea of an action coming back to the person who did the action, i.e. **reflecting back** to the doer.

***

***

***

DHP 131

***

pecca so na labha**te** sukhaṃ.

***

***

after death, he does not **get** happiness **for himself**

***

after death, he does not **personally get** happiness

***

after death, he **himself** does not get happiness

***

after death, he **gets** no happiness.

***

***

Please note! The Reflexive Voice is also sometimes used **just for the sake of the meter** of the verse, so you must judge for yourself when to apply the reflexive meaning - sometimes it will not make sense!
