# Three Voices: Active, Reflexive and Passive
***
In English there are only **two voices**, active and passive.
***
Active voice: The man cut the tree
***
Passive: The tree is cut by the man.
***
In Pāli that would be rendered as
***
puriso rukkhaṃ chindati
***
rukkho purisena chindīyati
***
In Sanskrit, there are **three distinct voices of verbs**, active, **reflexive or middle** and passive. In Pāli (as in all the other Prakrit languages), only two voices are now primarily used, the active and the passive.
***
The only time you will encounter the middle or reflexive voice is in poetry, but it is important to recognise it, since these verses contain important and subtle doctrinal ideas.
***
### Active Voice
***
Almost all the verbs you have dealt with so far have been in the active **voice**.
***
the way the active voice is constructed is:
***
**root + conjugational sign \> base**
***
√dhā (to put) + a \> daha (irreg)
***
**prefixes + base + parassapada verbal endings**
***
saṃ + ā + daha + ti \> samādahati
***
Hopefully you have no problems with that.
***
### Passive Voice
***
You have also learned how to form passive verbs in this way:
***
**root + passive sign \> passive base**
***
√dhā + iya \> dhiya (pass)
***
**prefixes + passive base + parassapada verbal endings**
***
saṃ + ā + dhiya + ti \> samādhiyati
***
### Middle Voice or Reflexive Voice
***
As mentioned, this voice has virtually died out in prose, but still exists to a significant degree within verse. First let’s look at the construction, then at the meaning.
***
the middle voice is constructed using an **active base** with **attanopada verbal endings**.
***
**root + conjugational sign \> base**
***
√labh (to get) + a \> labha
***
**prefixes + base + attanopada verbal ending**
***
labha + **te** \> labha**te**
***
How to translate this?
***
Reflexive verbs can be translated into English with a **reflexive pronoun.**
***
labha**te**
***
he **himself** gets something
***
he obtains something **for himself**
***
The reflexive voice contains the idea of an action coming back to the person who did the action, i.e. **reflecting back** to the doer.
***
DHP 131
***
pecca so na labha**te** sukhaṃ.
***
after death, he does not **get** happiness **for himself**
***
after death, he does not **personally get** happiness
***
after death, he **himself** does not get happiness
***
after death, he **gets** no happiness.
***
Please note! The Reflexive Voice is also sometimes used **just for the sake of the meter** of the verse, so you must judge for yourself when to apply the reflexive meaning - sometimes it will not make sense!
