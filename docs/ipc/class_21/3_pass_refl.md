# Passive Reflexive

Today we are going to learn another way to form passive verbs, which is exactly the same, except with **attanopada** endings.

**root + passive sign \> passive base**

√dhā + iya \> dhiya (pass)

**prefixes + passive base + attanopada verbal endings**

saṃ + ā + dhiya + te \> samādhiyate

In theory passive voice with an **attanopada** verbal ending can be translated into English with a reflexive pronoun.

cittaṃ samādhiya**te** – the mind becomes settled **by itself**.

but practically the meaning is the same.

cittaṃ samādhiya**te** – the mind becomes settled.

cittaṃ samādhiya**ti** – the mind becomes settled.

as usual with a few exceptions

In Sanskrit, passive and intransitive verbs **must** take the attanopada endings e.g.

“is said to be; is called”:

Pāli - vucca**ti**

Sanskrit - vācya**te**

In Pāli this is more flexible and either **parassapada** or **attanopada** verbal ending can be used.

In summary, in Pāli you can find the passive voice with **parassapada** and **attanopada** endings; the meaning is the same.
