## Imperfect Past Tense (*hiyyattanī*)

***

Kaccāyana 418. hiyyopabhuti paccakkhe hiyyattanī.

***

“starting from yesterday, when seen, is imperfect past tense”

***

***

As the name implies, **hiyyo** means “yesterday”, this past tense was used for events which happened before yesterday, but were seen by the speaker.

***

***

Modern grammars translate it as a continuous past tense “was going”, but it’s safe to translate it just as a normal past tense “went”.

***

***

This past tense has also almost completely died out in Pāli, apart from some common roots like √gam √chid √dis √vac etc, and mostly in poetry. In DPD there are about **38** Tipiṭaka examples so far.

This verbal form also can take an **a-** augment in front, like the aorist. Let’s look at the conjugation.

Technically there is also a **Passive Imperfect Past**. How would that be formed?
