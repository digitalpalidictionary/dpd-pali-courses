***
When two or more words are **combined** to form a **single** **unit**, the result is called a *samāsa*, or compound. e.g. devamanussā.

Grammatically, it is functioning as one unit. Normally only the **last word** in the compound is **declined**, the others remain in their vocative / dictionary / stem form / lemma. e.g. devamanussānaṃ

Traditional Pāli grammar books have an extremely detailed analysis and understanding of compounds.
