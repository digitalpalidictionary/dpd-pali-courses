# Prefixes (upasagga)
***
Prefixes are attached to the beginning of nouns, verbs & adjectives. They can modify, intensify, completely change, or, in some cases, leave the meaning of the root unchanged.
***
Traditional grammarians consider there to be three types of prefixes.
***
**1. dhātv’atth’ānuvattaka**
***
(root – meaning – following along)
***
These prefixes don’t change the meaning of the root at all.
***
e.g. √bhā (to shine)
***
bhāti (shines)
***
**ā**bhāti (shines)
***
**2. dhātv’atthabādhaka**
***
(root – meaning - obstructing)
***
These prefixes completely change or even reverse the meaning of the root.
***
e.g. √raj 3 ya (desire)
***
rajjati (is attached)
***
**vi**rajjati (is detached)
***
**3. dhātv’atthavisesaka**
***
(root – meaning - enhancer)
***
These prefixes add some flavour and nuance to the meaning of the root.
***
e.g. √har (to carry)
***
harati (carries)
***
**ā**harati (brings back)
***
**o**harati (shaves, lit. takes down)
***
**nī**harati (removes, extracts)
***
**pa**harati (beats, strikes)
***
Here is the list of 20 prefixes according to traditional sources
***
**pa, parā, ni, nī, u(d), du(r), saṃ, vi, ava, anu, pari, adhi, abhi, pati, su, ā, ati, api, apa, upa**
