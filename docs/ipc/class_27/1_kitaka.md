## Primary Derivatives (kitaka)

***

**Primary derivatives** are formed by adding a **suffix** directly onto the **root or base.**

There are two types of primary derivatives, **kita** and **kicca**.

***

***

**Kita** (lit. done) include all the suffixes which create **nouns**, **adjectives**, **substantives** and the **present and past** **participles**. e.g. \*a, \*ana, \*aka, ma, nta, māna, etc.

***

***

**Kicca** (lit. to be done) are only those suffixes which create the **potential** **participles**. e.g. tabba, anīya, \*ya, \*tya, etc.

***

***

The suffix added onto the root or base is called a **kita** or **kicca** and the resulting derivative word is called a **kitaka.**

All the normal rules of sandhi and assimilation apply.
