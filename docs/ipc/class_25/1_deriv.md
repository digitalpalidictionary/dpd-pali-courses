# Derivatives
***
So far we have looked at how verbs and participles are formed, now we take a look at how **nouns**, **adjectives** and **substantives** are formed.
***
The root is a primitive or abstract idea expressed by a monosyllabic word, e.g. √pac (cook). Note that it is not an actual verb “cook” but the **abstract concept** of cooking itself.
***
The abstract concept of the root gets turned into a meaningful word by the addition of suffixes added to the root. These suffixes are called **Derivatives,** and the process is called **Derivation**.
***
Suffixes called **kita** and **kicca** are added directly to the root to form **Primary Derivatives** or **kitaka**.
***
e.g. √cit (think) + \***as** \> cet**as** (mind)
***
*dhātu + kita / kicca \> kitaka*
***
Suffixes called **taddhita** are added to the Primary Derivatives to form **Secondary Derivatives** or **taddhita.**
***
cetas + **ika** \> cetas**ika** (mental component)
***
## *kitaka + taddhita \> taddhita*
