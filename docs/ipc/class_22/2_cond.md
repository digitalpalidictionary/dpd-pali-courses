The Conditional[^12], expressing future time relatively to something that is past, and an action unable to be performed on account of some difficulty in the way of its execution. (Charles Duroiselle)

[^12]: Examples in english: If he hadn't left, we would have had our class face to face. (or) if he would have been here, we will have our class
