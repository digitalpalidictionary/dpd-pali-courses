# Conditional Tense (*kālātipatti*)
***
Kaccāyana 422. kriy’ātipanne’tīte kālātipatti.
***
“when action has expired in the past, conditional”
***
The Conditional[^12], expressing future time relatively to something that is past, and an action unable to be performed on account of some difficulty in the way of its execution. (Charles Duroiselle)

[^12]: Examples in english: If he hadn't left, we would have had our class face to face. (or) if he would have been here, we will have our class
***
Now, let’s look at the conditional tense **active and reflexive** **voice.** The **conditional passive** only exists in grammar books.
***
How is the conditional reflexive formed? (Theoretically) How is the passive formed?
***
