### How to do the Homeless work
***
1\. Find the suttas in DPR and use the translations available there to help you also use Buddha’s Words or SuttaCentral
***
2\. Do a full grammatical analysis, breaking up all sandhis. Please translate every sentence. For example:
***
AN 5.57 **nāhaṃ** bhabbo etarahi kāmāni paṭisevituṃ.
***
| nāhaṃ                                                              | sandhi |          | I not             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|-------------------|
|  **na-**                                                           | ind    | neg      | not               |
|  **ahaṃ**                                                          | pn     | 1.n.s    | I                 |
| bhabbo                                                             | adj    | m.n.s    | possible          |
| etarahi                                                            | ind    | adv      | now               |
| kāmāni                                                             | n      | nt.ac.pl | sensual pleasures |
| paṭisevituṃ                                                        | v      | inf      | to indulge in     |
|                                                                    |        |          |                   |
|  **na-**                                                           | ind    | neg      | not[^2]           |
|  **ahaṃ**                                                          | pn     | 1.n.s    | I                 |
|                                                                    |        |          |                   |
| **Now it is not possible for me to indulge in sensual pleasures.** |        |          |                   |

[^2]: This is because the exercise document does not include a space after the actual sandhi, but it does have an empty space after each sentence. This is done to prevent giving students hints about where the sandhi occurs.
***
3\. Meet a day or two before class to discuss your answers. Each of you should take turns first reading the Pāli, then your translation. If your translation differs from others, discuss the grammar in detail to understand why it differs. You will learn a lot from this process.
***
4\. Whatever problems you cannot solve, or if there is anything you are unsure about, please ask about them in the next class.
