Sandhi literally means placing together, combination, connecting, combining. It is sometimes called euphonic combination, which means “sweet sounding combination.”

***

It refers to the changes that take place when different parts of the language are joined together.

***

***

This occurs at every level of the language, from the formation of words to the basic elements of roots, prefixes, suffixes, and secondary derivatives, all the way to building complex compounds that consist of many words joined together.
