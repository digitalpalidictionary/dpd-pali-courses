### Intransitive, transitive and di-transitive verbs

***

When you make a verb into a causative,

***

***

1\. intransitive verbs become transitive, e.g.

***

***

tassa cittaṃ na **kampati**

***

his mind **does** not **shake** (intransitive)

***

***

mahāvātā vāyantā udakaṃ **kampenti**

***

great blowing winds **causes** the water **to shake** (transitive)

***

***

***

2\. transitive verbs *may* become di-transitive.

***

***

In the following sentence, the verb takes two objects, a direct and indirect object:

***

***

rājā **purisaṃ** **rukkhaṃ** chindāpeti

***

***

**rukkhaṃ** is the **direct** object

***

**purisaṃ** is the **indirect** object

***

***

The indirect object can also be in the **instrumental** case

***

rājā **purisena** **rukkhaṃ** chindāpeti

***

***

***

3\. di-transitive verbs may become multi-transitive (in theory anyway)

***

***

Please remember a whole family of related words can be built from one causal base, e.g. √bhū + \*e \> bhāve
