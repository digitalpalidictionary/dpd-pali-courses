### Intransitive, transitive and di-transitive verbs
***
When you make a verb into a causative,
***
1\. intransitive verbs become transitive, e.g.
***
tassa cittaṃ na **kampati**
***
his mind **does** not **shake** (intransitive)
***
mahāvātā vāyantā udakaṃ **kampenti**
***
great blowing winds **causes** the water **to shake** (transitive)
***
2\. transitive verbs *may* become di-transitive.
***
In the following sentence, the verb takes two objects, a direct and indirect object:
***
rājā **purisaṃ** **rukkhaṃ** chindāpeti
***
**rukkhaṃ** is the **direct** object
***
**purisaṃ** is the **indirect** object
***
The indirect object can also be in the **instrumental** case
***
rājā **purisena** **rukkhaṃ** chindāpeti
***
3\. di-transitive verbs may become multi-transitive (in theory anyway)
***
Please remember a whole family of related words can be built from one causal base, e.g. √bhū + \*e \> bhāve
