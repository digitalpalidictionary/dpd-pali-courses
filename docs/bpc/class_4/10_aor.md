# The Aorist or Past Tense (ajjatanī)

The Aorist is the most common form of Past Tense in the Tipiṭaka. It is formed directly on the root or on the base.
***
**It can be formed on the root:**
***
this occurs mostly with group 1 roots
***
√har 1 a (carry)
***
√har + **i** \> har**i** (he carried)
***
√nand 1 a (be happy)
***
abhi + √nand + **i** \> abhinand**i** (he was delighted)
***
**Or it can be formed on the verbal base:**
***
just like the present tense
***
√bhuj 2 ṃa (eat, enjoy) \> bhuñja

bhuñja + i \> bhuñji (he ate, enjoyed)
***
√mant 8 aya (counsel, invite) \> mantaya
***
ā + mantaya + **i** \> āmantayi (he addressed)
***
what would **another form** of this verb be?[^13]

[^13]: āmantesi
***
**Sometimes the aorist takes an augment of “a”**
***
√ṭhā 1 a (stand)
***
a + √ṭhā + si \> **a**ṭṭhāsi (he stood)
***
√dā 1 a (give)
***
a + √dā + si \> **a**dāsi (he gave)
