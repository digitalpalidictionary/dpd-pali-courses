### Negative particle “no”

The particle **“no”** expresses the meaning “not” (although it also has many other meanings, so be careful!)

This is used in the same way as **neither** … **nor** in English.

### Prohibitive Particle “mā”

***
Don’t do evil deeds!
***
kiṃ nu kujjhasi? **mā kujjhi!** (SN 21.9)
