# With & together with “saddhiṃ” and “saha”

In Pāli only the instrumental case can express the meaning of **with** or **together with**.
***
ahaṃ mitt**ena** nagaraṃ agacchiṃ
***
I went to town **with** my friend.
***
The word **saddhiṃ + instrumental case** can also be used to give the same meaning.
***
ahaṃ mitt**ena** **saddhiṃ** nagaraṃ agacchiṃ
***
I went to town **together with** my friend.
***
Another preposition which is similarly used is “**saha**” which also has the meaning **with, together with** or **accompanied by.** It is much more common in the Khuddaka Nikāya and in later Pāli literature.
