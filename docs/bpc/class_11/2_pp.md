# (Passive) Past Participles

The past participle is another **verbal adjective** which describes the action that a noun did (in the past). It is extremely common in the Tipiṭaka.

|---|---|
| bhāsati     | he speaks           |
| **bhāsita** | (is) **spoken**     |
| bhāveti     | he cultivates       |
| **bhāvita** | (is) **cultivated** |
| bhindati    | he breaks           |
| **bhinna**  | (is) **broken**     |
***
Please note that the past participle is **passive** in meaning.

### How to form a past participle
***
In theory the formation of past participles is very easy, just add -**ta**, -**ita** or -**na** to the root.
***
In practice, they can be quite tricky because many **sandhi** rules may apply, and their formation is heavily influenced by the **Sanskrit** **roots** from which they are derived.
***
Until you learn more about Sandhi and Sanskrit roots, you will have to just learn the forms of the past participle by heart.
***
There are, quite literally, thousands of examples...
***
#### 1. root + ta

| | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| bhavati  | √bhū  | to be     | + ta | bhūta      | became    |
| passati  | √dis  | to see    | + ta | di**ṭṭ**ha | seen      |
| gacchati | √gam  | to go     | + ta | gata       | gone      |

| labhati  | √labh | to get    | + ta | la**dd**ha | received  |
| marati   | √mar  | to die    | + ta | mata       | dead      |
| mussati  | √mus  | to forget | + ta | mu**ṭṭ**ha | forgotten |
| jānāti   | √ñā   | to know   | + ta | ñāta       | known     |

When we study sandhi, we will study the rules related to the changes that happen with **ta**

### How to use Past Participles
***
1\. They often get used as the **verb** in the sentence, having a past passive meaning.
***
evaṃ me **sutaṃ**
***
lit. thus - by me – **heard**
***
fig. Thus **has been heard** by me
***
Notice that the **agent** of the sentence “**me**” is in the instrumental case. This is a normal construction for passive verbs.
***
Active: **He** saw the tree (agent in nominative)
***
Passive: The tree was seen **by him.** (agent in instrumental)
***
2\. Past participles are very often used as **nouns**
***
atthi **dinnaṃ** atthi **yiṭṭhaṃ** atthi **hutaṃ** *MN 41*
***
lit. there is **given,** there is **sacrificed**, there is **offered**
***
there is (what is) **given,** there is (what is) **sacrificed**, there is (what is) **offered**
***
there is (what has been) **given,** there is (what has been) **sacrificed**, there is (what has been) **offered**
***
3\. They are also very often used as **adjectives**, agreeing with the nouns in gender, case & number.
***
seyyathāpi **suddhaṃ** vatthaṃ **apagataṃ** kāḷakaṃ … *DN 14.14*
***
lit. just like a **cleaned** cloth, **gone away** stains ...
***
How would you translate that into English?
