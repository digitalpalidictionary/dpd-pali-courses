# The Infinitive (tumanta)

Another verbal form without declensions is the **infinitive**. It most commonly expresses a **purpose**.
***
I will go to the forest **to see** the Buddha
***
ahaṃ buddhaṃ **passituṃ** araññaṃ gacchissāmi
***
The infinitive can be translated as
***
*“to see”*
***
*“in order to see”*
***
*“for the purpose of seeing”*
***
### How to form the infintive



#### 1. root + -tuṃ
***
The infinitive can be formed by adding the suffix **-tuṃ** to the root
***
| √dā  | + tuṃ | dātuṃ      | to give        |
|------|-------|------------|----------------|
| √gam | + tuṃ | ga**n**tuṃ | to go          |
| √han | + tuṃ | hantuṃ     | to kill        |
| √kar | + tuṃ | k**ā**tuṃ  | to do, to make |
| √ñā  | + tuṃ | ñātuṃ      | to know        |
***
#### 2. root + -ituṃ
***
The infinitive can be formed by added the suffix **-ituṃ** to the root.
***
| √bandh  | + ituṃ | bandhituṃ  | to tie, bind |
|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| √bhakkh | + ituṃ | bhakkhituṃ | to eat       |

| √pucch  | + ituṃ | pucchituṃ  | to ask       |

#### 3. base + -ituṃ

Very rarely, the infinitive can be formed by added the suffix **-ituṃ** to the base.

| √suc  | soca   | + ituṃ | socituṃ   | to grieve |
***
#### 4. bases ending in -e + tuṃ

In the case of **group 8 verbs** (*e, aya*) and **causative verbs**, *-tuṃ* is added to the base ending in -*e*.
***
| √bhū  | bhāve | + tuṃ | bhāvetuṃ | to develop     |

### Some verbs always take an infinitive
***
Some verbs like **arahati** (he deserves, is worthy), **sakkoti** (he is able) almost always take an infinitive, just like in English.
***
na te ahaṃ *sakkomi* vitthārena dhammaṃ **desetuṃ** (VIN 4.1.14)
***
I *am* not *able* **to preach** the Dhamma in detail to you.
***
samaṇo gotamo *arahati* bhavantaṃ kūṭadantaṃ **upasaṅkamituṃ** (DN 5.2)
***
Ascetic Gotama *ought* **to approach** Sir Crooked Tooth.
