# Passive Verbs
***
All the verbs you have seen so far have been active verbs, which means the subject does the action to the object.
***
ahaṃ rukkhaṃ na **chindāmi**
***
I do not **cut** the tree
***
With Passive Verbs, the action is done to the subject by an **agent in the instrumental case**, just like in English.
***
rukkho mayā **chindīyati** / rukkho me **chijjati**
***
The tree **is cut** by me.
***
### How to form Passive Verbs
***
To make a passive verb, first you need to make a **passive** **base**. Remember the formula for making a base?
***
**Root + Conjugational Sign \> Base**
***
To make a passive verb is even easier
***
**1. Root + ya \> Passive Base**
***
**2. Root + iya \> Passive Base**
***
**3. Root + īya \> Passive Base**
***
**Passive Base + Verbal Ending \> Passive Verb**
***
Sometimes the only way to recognise if a verb is passive is by the passive base
***
1\. root + **ya**
***
| **√badh** | to tie     | + ya | **bajjha** | **bajjha**ti | is tied     |
|-----------|------------|------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **√bhid** | to break   | + ya | **bhijja** | **bhijja**ti | is broken   |
| **√han**  | to kill    | + ya | **hañña**  | **hañña**ti  | is killed   |
| **√ji**   | to conquer | + ya | **jīya**   | **jīya**ti   | is defeated |
| **√khād** | to eat     | + ya | **khajja** | **khajja**ti | is eaten    |
| **√labh** | to obtain  | + ya | **labbha** | **labbha**ti | is obtained |

2\. root + **iya** + verbal ending (less common)
***

|----------|----------|-------|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **√kar** | to do    | + iya | **kariya** | **kariya**ti     | is done           |

***
3\. root + **īya** + verbal ending (less common)
***
| **√dā**  | to give  | + īya | **dīya**   | **dīya**ti   | is given   |
|----------|----------|-------|------------|--------------|------------|

| **√pā**  | to drink | + īya | **pīya**   | **pīya**ti   | is drunk   |
***
4\. Verbs in **group 3** can also be used in the passive voice without adding a passive sign.

They are formed as normal **group 3** verbs, and typically have an agent in the **instrumental case**.

root + **ya** + verbal ending

| **√sam** | to be calm         | + ya | **samma** | **samma**ti | is calmed; is cooled         |
|----------|--------------------|------|-----------|-------------|------------------------------|
| **√mad** | to be intoxicated  | + ya | **majja** | **majja**ti | is intoxicated; is stupefied |
| **√mus** | to lie, forget     | + ya | **mussa** | **mussa**ti | is forgotten                 |
| **√luj** | to be broken apart | + ya | **lujja** | **lujja**ti | is broken; is erased         |
| **√saj** | to stick           | + ya | **sajja** | **sajja**ti | is attached; lit. is stuck   |
***
5\. In some cases, passive verbs from **groups 2 and 3** can be formed on the base + passive sign:
***
**base** + **iya** / **īya** + verbal ending

| **√yuj**  | yuñja  | + iya | **yuñjiya**  | anu**yuñjiya**ti   | is examined; lit. is engaged |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| **√bhuj** | bhuñja | + iya | **bhuñjiya** | pari**bhuñjiya**ti | is fully used                |
| **√chid** | chinda | + īya | **chindīya** | ac**chindīya**ti   | is plundered                 |
| **√muc**  | muñca  | + īya | **muñcīya**  | **muñcīya**ti      | is freed                     |
| **√rudh** | rundha | + īya | **rundhīya** | **rundhīya**ti     | is obstructed                |
