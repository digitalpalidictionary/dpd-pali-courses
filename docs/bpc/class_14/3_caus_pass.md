# Causative Passive Verbs
***
Just to really mess with your minds, you can combine **causative** and **passive** verbs together.
***
The **causative** verb means “he causes to do”.
***
The **causative passive** verb means "it is caused to be done" or, more rarely, "he causes it to be done," depending on the context.
***
They are formed by adding the passive suffixes *-***ya** *-***iya** or *-***īya** onto the **causative** **base**
***
or, much more rarely, adding a causative suffix to a passive base (vibhajjeti \> √bhaj + ya + \*e)
***
**Here are some examples**
***

### How To Form Causative Passive Present Participle
***
**√root + \*e / \*aya / \*āpe / \*āpaya \> causative base**
***
**causative base + ya / iya / īya \> causative passive base**
***
Don't worry, that's probably the trickiest construction in the entire Pāli language. There are very few of them in the Tipiṭaka.
