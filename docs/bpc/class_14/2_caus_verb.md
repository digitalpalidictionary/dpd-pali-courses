# Causative Verbs

This is a concept that exists in most Indian languages, but is foreign to English. Having said that, the idea is quite simple.

***

***

ahaṃ gehaṃ **karomi**. (active verb)

***

I build a house.

***

***

ahaṃ thapatiṃ gehaṃ **kāremi**. (causative verb)

***

I cause a carpenter to build a house.

***

***

What is the object / accusative of the first sentence?

***

What is the object / accusative of the second sentence?

### Transitive, Intransitive And Di-Transitive Verbs

***

Remember earlier we discussed **transitive**, **intransitive** and **di-transitive** verbs. Can you remember what they are?

***

***

When you make a verb into a causative,

***

***

1\. intransitive verbs become transitive

***

2\. transitive verbs become di-transitive

***

3\. di-transitive verbs become multi-transitive (in theory anyway)

***

***



#### Example 1: Intransitive \> Transitive

1\. bhavati (active verb) “he is” is an intransitive verb which takes no object in the accusative case.

***

***

so bhikkhu **bhavati**

***

he **is** a monk

***

***

bhāveti (causative verb), literally “he causes to be”, is a transitive verb which takes one object in the accusative case

***

***

so mettacittaṃ **bhāveti**

***

he **develops** a friendly mind.

***

(lit. he **causes** a friendly mind **to be.**)

***

***

***

#### Example 2: Transitive \> Di-Transitive

**carati** (active verb) “he walks” is transitive and takes one object in the accusative case

***

***

so gāmaṃ **carati.**

***

He **walks** to the village.

***

***

**cāreti** (causative verb) “he causes to walk” is di-transitive and takes two objects in the accusative case.

***

***

so naraṃ gāmaṃ **cāreti.**

***

He **causes** the man **to walk** to the village.

***

***

***

in this example, the instrumental case can also be used for the person who is caused to do the action.

***

***

so narena gāmaṃ **cāreti.**

***

He **causes** the man **to walk** to the village.

***

***

It makes no sense if you translate directly into English, so please be aware of this Pāli syntax.

***

**Example 3: di-transitive \> multi-transitive**

***

**siñcati** is an example of a di-transitive verb, which takes two objects in the accusative case.

***

***

bhikkhu udakaṃ mattikaṃ **siñceyya** VIN PAT PC 20 (simpl)

***

A monk **could pour** water to the earth.

***

***

(In theory), when *siñcati* becomes causative, it can take three objects in the accusative case.

***

bhikkhu aññaṃ bhikkhuṃ udakaṃ mattikaṃ **siñcāpeyya**

A monk **could cause** another monk **to pour** water to the earth.

***

***

In reality, if you find even one example of that, please let us know =)

### How To Form Causative Verbs

Causative Verbs are formed by adding suffixes to the root to create a **causative base**.

***

***

√pat 1 a (fall) + **a \> pata** (active base) \> patati

***

√pat + **\*e \> pāte** (causative base) \> pāteti

***

√pat + **\*aya \> pātaya** (causative base) \> pātayati

***

√pat + **\*āpe \> pātāpe** (causative base) \> pātāpeti

***

ati + √pat + **\*āpaya \> pātāpaya** (causative base) \> atipātāpayati

***

***

Notice that the vowel of the root gets **strengthened,** **pat** \> **pāt**. This is a common feature of causative verbs if the vowel which can be strengthened is followed by a single consonant.

***

***

In summary:

***

***

1.  **Root + \*e \> Causative Base**

***

2.  **Root + \*aya \> Causative Base**

***

3.  **Root + \*āpe \> Causative Base**

***

4.  **Root + \*āpaya \> Causative Base**

***

Now, where have you seen the suffix *-\****e** and *-\****aya** being added to the root?

***

### Group 8 Causative Verbs

***

√cud + \***e** \> cod**e**ti (he accuses)

***

√cud + \***aya** \> cod**aya**ti (he accuses)

***

***

In the case of group 8 verbs, they only take the causative suffixes *-***āpe** and *-***āpaya**

***

***

√cud + \***āpe** \> cod**āpe**ti (he causes to accuse)

***

√cud + \***āpaya** \> cod**āpaya**ti (he causes to accuse)

***

***

***

### How To Decline Causative Verbs

***

Other than the base, the declension of causative verbs follows the normal pattern in all the tenses.

***

***

√pac + \*āpe \> pācāpe (causes to cook)

***

**present**: pācāpe**ti** pācāpe**nti** pācāpe**si**  pācāpe**tha** pācāpe**mi** pācāpe**ma**

***

**future**: pācāpe**ssati** pācāpe**ssanti** pācāpe**ssasi** pācāpe**ssatha** pācāpe**ssāmi** pācāpe**ssāma**

***

**imperative**: pācāpe**tu** pācāpe**ntu** pācāpe**hi** pācāpe**tha** pācāpe**mi** pācāpe**ma**

***

**optative**: pācāpe**yya** pācāpe**yyuṃ** pācāpe**yyāsi** pācāpe**yyātha** pācāpe**yyaṃ** pācāpe**yyāma** pācāpe**yyāmi**

***

***

***

How would you decline √**pac + \*e \> pāce**

***

in the present?

***

in the future?

***

in the imperative?

***

in the optative?

***

### How To Translate Causative Verbs

***

This can be tricky sometimes because if you translate every causative verb as “he causes someone to do something” or “he makes someone do something”, it can sound quite clumsy in English.

***

***

rājā dāse pāsādaṃ **kārāpeti**

***

The king **causes** the slaves **to build** a mansion.

***

The king **makes** the slaves **build** a mansion.

***

The king **gets** the slaves **to build** a mansion.

***

The king **has** a mansion **built** by the slaves.

***

***

Some causative verbs have natural English equivalents

***

***

√mar (die) + \*e \> māre \> **māreti**

***

he causes to die = **he kills**

***

***

√sam (calm) + \*e \> sāme \> **sāmeti**

***

he causes to calm = **he stills, he calms**

***

***

√bhū (be) + \*e \> bhāve \> **bhāveti**

***

he causes to be = **he develops, he cultivates**

***
