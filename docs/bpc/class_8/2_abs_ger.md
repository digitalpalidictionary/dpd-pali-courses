### Practical Distinction between Absolutives and Gerunds

DPD is based on the study of hundreds of verbal forms found throughout the Tipiṭaka over the last decade. From this material, a fairly clear practical conclusion has emerged: there appears to be a functional distinction between two types of forms.

-   Completed actions — **absolutives**, typically ending in **-tvā**, **-itvā**, **-tvāna**, etc.

*(clear example free from interpretations which can not be doubt)*

-   Ongoing or contemporaneous actions — **gerunds**, typically ending in **-ya**, **-iya**, **-eyya**, etc.

    In some context **gerands** can be translated same as **absolutives** - as completed actions.

*(clear example free from interpretations which can not be doubt)*

The commentaries, of course, regularly gloss verbs ending in **-ya** with equivalent **-tvā** forms, without making any explicit distinction between them.

Here, however, we invite you to put this distinction to the test. Please observe the usage carefully and let us know if you encounter examples that do not fit this pattern.

There are certainly exceptions. DPD already includes dictionary entries that indicate the contextual meaning in such cases.
