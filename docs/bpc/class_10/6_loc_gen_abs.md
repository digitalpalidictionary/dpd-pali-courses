## Locative Absolute

When a **noun** or a **pronoun** in the **locative** case is used with a **participle** in the same case as itself, the construction is called Locative Absolute.

The **subject** of the sentence and the **participle** are in the locative **case**, often as a clause before the main sentence.

It can be translated as **when**, **while**, **since**, or **as**.

dev**e** vassant**e** (when the sky is raining)

asant**e** hārak**e** (when there is no carrier)

paṭiggahetvā tiyojanaparamaṃ sahatthā haritabbāni asante hārake. (VIN PAT NP 16)

Having accepted, it can be carried by oneself for three yojanas at the most, **when** there is no carrier.

## Genitive Absolute

Like the Locative Absolute, the Genitive Absolute also can be translated as **when**, **as**, **while**, etc. Sometimes it also has the meaning of **since**, **although**, **even if**, **despite**, **in spite of**, **notwithstanding**

**āturakāyassa** **me** **sato**, cittaṃ anāturaṃ bhavissatī'ti *SN 22.1*



Although I am sick in body, (my) mind will be healthy.
