# Definite and indefinite article

*A man* – here “a” is called the **indefinite article**, it refers to some unspecified man, not to a specific man.

There is no indefinite article in Pāli. If you want to translate from English to Pāli: “He drank some milk.” Just use the word milk, it already has the sense of “some milk”.

*The man* - “the” is called the **definite** **article**, it refers to some specific man. Pāli **aññatara**, can be used for a specific person or thing.
