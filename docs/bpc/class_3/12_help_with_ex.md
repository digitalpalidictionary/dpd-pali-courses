### Word Order

English has typical **SVO** word order: **S**ubject **V**erb **O**bject
***
Pāli has **SOV** word order. **S**ubject **O**bject **V**erb
***
e.g. English: the man goes to the village
***
Pāli: naro gāmaṃ gacchati (man village he goes)
***
There are, of course, numerous exceptions, but this is most common in Pāli prose.

### The genitive case

The genitive case always comes *before* the noun it qualifies.
***
e.g. the body of the man, the man’s body
***
manussassa kāyo
***
### Agreement between nouns (pronouns…) and verbs

The **subject** of the sentence and the **verb** must **agree** in **number**.

e.g. sakuṇā ākāse uḍḍayanti.
