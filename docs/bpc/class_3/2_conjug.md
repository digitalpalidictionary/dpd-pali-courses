# Conjugation of Verbs
***
*“***Conjugation***, or the inflection of verbs, consists in making the verbal root undergo* **certain changes in form***, by the addition to it of certain* **prefixes** *and* **terminations** *to show the difference of* **Voice***, of* **Tense***, of* **Mode***, of* **Person***, and of* **Number***.”*
