# Historical Present



In Pāli, verbs in the **present tense** are sometimes used to describe **past events**.  
This is called the [**historical present**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_present)

It is grammatically present tense, but is **translated in the past tense** in English.

Usually used in sutta introductions.

*Atha kho bhagavā ārāmaṃ gacchati.*

Lit. Then the Blessed One goes to the monastery.

But in translation we say:

Then the Blessed One went to the monastery.
